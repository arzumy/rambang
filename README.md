rambang
=========
Rambang will generate random Malay word. Originally created to test out my malay text-to-speech system

Usage
=========
`require rubygems
require rambang
rambang = Rambang.new
rambang.word => "ayam"
`

Note on Patches/Pull Requests
=========
* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a
  future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history.
  (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
